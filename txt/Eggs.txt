BEAT eggs, milk, salt and pepper in bowl until blended.


HEAT butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. 
POUR IN egg mixture.


As eggs begin to set, GENTLY PULL the eggs across the pan with an inverted turner, forming large soft curds. 
CONTINUE cooking – pulling, lifting and folding eggs – until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.
Do not stir constantly. REMOVE from heat. SERVE stove top scrambled eggs.
